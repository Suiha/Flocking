Flocking is a natural phenomena in which a group of animals all move together at the same velocity; the most common examples of this in nature are birds and fish. Using C++ and OpenFrameworks, I created flocking programs (both 2D and 3D) simulating flocking behavior based on Craig W. Reynolds' flocking model. The boids in the flock are initialized with random speeds and directions, and through physics-based movement begin to simulate flocking behavior through separation, cohesion, and alignment functions.
